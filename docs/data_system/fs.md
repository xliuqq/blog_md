# FS

## [seaweedfs](https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs)

**compare to HDFS**

- ideal for serving **relatively smaller files quickly and concurrently**ï¼›
- "weed upload/download" tool to store extra large files by splitting them into manageable data chunks

**compared to MoofseFS**

- designed for keeping large amounts (like several thousands) of very big files
- MooseFS Master Server keeps all meta data in memory. Same issue as HDFS namenode.



**Compared to MinIO**

- MinIO each file write will incur extra writes to corresponding meta file
- MinIO does not have optimization for lots of small files.
- MinIO has multiple disk IO to read one file. SeaweedFS has O(1) disk reads, even for erasure coded files.
- MinIO has full-time erasure coding. SeaweedFS uses replication on hot data for faster speed and optionally applies erasure coding on warm data.
