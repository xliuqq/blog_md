# Apache HttpComponents

> The Commons HttpClient project is now end of life, and is no longer being developed. It has been replaced by the [Apache HttpComponents](http://hc.apache.org/) project in its [HttpClient](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga) and [HttpCore](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-core-ga/) modules, which offer better performance and more flexibility.
